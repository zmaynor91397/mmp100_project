		<h2>The first aid kit</h2>
		<p>
			Even though the crash was probably rough. You didn't get seriously injured. just some cuts and bruises.
			<br>
			<br>
			You see a first aid cabinet at the end of a corridor. The least you could do right now is clean yourself up a bit.
			<br>
			<br>
			As you make your way to the cabinet the ship creeks at your every step. You gotta get out of this metal coffin soon.
			<br>
			<br>
			You open the cabinet. But opening it set of some sort of chain reaction within the ship's already weak integrity.
			<br>
			<br>
			Some panels fall, and the walls quickly come undone.
			<br>
			<br>
			You try to move out of the way, but on of the big steele walls falls on you. 
			<br>
			<br>
			With all your strengh you try to hold it up long enough, but these walls weren't made to be lifted by a single man.
			<br>
			<br>
			It slowly crushes you. Gasping for air only makes it hard to keep it up. You feel your bones beginning to crack.
			<br>
			<br>
			You try to scream for help in the hopes that someone can hear you, but the crushing pain keeps you from forming any thought whatsoever.
