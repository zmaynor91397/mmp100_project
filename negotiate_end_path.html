		<h2>Negotiation part II</h2>
		<p>
			The general would not hesitate to end this confrontation. So you're gonna have to convince her otherwise.
			<br>
			<br>
			"Alright general, you got the high ground here." you say.
			<br>
			<br>
			"oh, bounty hunter! Welcome back. I was worried I was gonna have to shoot an empty head. That wouldn't be fair " she laughs.
			<br>
			<br>
			"If you let me go, I can help you. The mission went bad, and my target got away. I can show you the best places to avoid and who to avoid. All I need in return is for you to drop me off at the nearest station" you say.
			<br>
			<br>
			The general's interests have been peaked. Bounty hunters are the most reliable when it comes to going off the grid.
			<br>
			<br>
			"I'll bite. but any attempt to cross me, and I'll end you." she lowers her rifle.
			<br>
			<br>
			Huge mistake. You go straight for your ankle pistol. By the time she sees you it's too late. you already take aim at her.
			<br>
			<br>
			BANG
