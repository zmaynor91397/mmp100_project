		<h2>confrontation</h2>
		<p>
			You're gonna try to negotiate with the general. you wont let them go, but you have to buy some time.
			<br>
			<br>
			A small dropship approaches you from the north, and lands a few meters away from you. It doesn't seem to be currently hostile, but you still keep your guard up.
			<br>
			<br>
			You put your hands up to show you are unarmed. The ship opens and the general steps out. She moves with elegance and at the same time brutality.
			<br>
			<br>
			She holds her rifle strong in her arms. if it weren't for your hands being up, she probably would have shot you on the spot.
			<br>
			<br>
			"You're quite the survivalist my friend, didn't think you'd walk out of that so easily."
			<br>
			<br>
			"It wasn't pretty" you say. "so what happens now?"
			<br>
			<br>
			"You know what happens now." she slowly raises here rifle"
