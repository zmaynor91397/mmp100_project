			You managed your way out of the ship. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The air is dry, and the sun beams hard on you.
			<br>
			<br>
			Neverending dunes of sand surround you. You succumb to a heavy sense of dread.
			<br>
			<br>
			You want nothing more but to panic, but something within you knows that panicking is not your strongest suit.
			<br>
			<br>
			As you try to keep your composure, you hear a distinct humming from the distance.
			<br>
			<br>
			The noise comes from the north. you see a ship heading towards you.
			<br>
			<br>
			Maybe it's help, or maybe it's trouble
