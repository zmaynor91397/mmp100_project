		<h2>Waiting for assistance</h2>
		<p>	
		   You step out of the wreckage. The air is dry, and the sun beams pretty damn hard on you.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   A small dropship approaches you from the north, and lands a few meters away from you. It doesn't seem to be hostile, but you still keep your guard up.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The ship opens and the general steps out. She moves with elegance and at the same time brutality. Her beauty strikes you off guard. 
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   She holds a rifle strong in her arms. That sense of safety you felt earlier quickly turned into worry.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   "You're quite the survivalist my friend, didn't think you'd walk out of that so easily."
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   "It wasn't pretty" you say. "so what happens now?"
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   "You know what happens now." she slowly raises here rifle"
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   "I don't believe I have anything of value. So why are you gonna do this." you claim.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   "You don't have anything of value, but I do, and I won't let you take it from me"
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   You're about to be murdered by someone you just met. You think through your options.
