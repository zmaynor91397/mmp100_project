		<H1>STRANDED</H1>
		<h2></h2>
		<p>
		   You don't see any other option but to fight her off. The adrenaline is rushing, and your blood pumps hot through your veins.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   At this point there is about ten feet between where you are standing and the barrel of her rifle.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Your mind races. It feels like time has slowed down.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   You see a decent size rock at your feet. Big enough to do some damage but not enough to end a fight.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   If you manage to strike the general with it, you will have enough time to draw the nail pistol on your ankle
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   You take a deep breath
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   KICK
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The rock launches in the air. It hits her rifle just enough to throw her off balance.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   You managed to whip out the pistol. She is already back on her feet and about to take aim, but so are you.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   BANG.
