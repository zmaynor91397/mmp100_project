		<h2>datapad alert screen.</h2>
		<p>
		   You tap the alert, it opens up a map of the immediate area, a white blip marks your location.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Another blip appears north from your location, this time it's red an it seems to be approaching you. This has to be the General.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Things weren't so friendly last time, so don't expect a warm welcome.
