		<h2>The bounty hunter</h2>
		<p>
		   The flood gates have open, you feel a huge weight lifted off your shoulders, all you needed was a jump start.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The sight of the mission briefing brings back all your memories. The crash was pretty rough, but this isn't your first rodeo with amnesia.
		   <br>
		   <br>	
		   You are mordecai, a bounty hunter and a damn good one too.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   While chasing your bounty throughout the galaxy, they somehow got the jump on you and crippled your ship.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   you managed to maneuver the vesssel to a nearby planet. The entire ship lost power and you were caught by the planets gravity field.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The laws of nature were not in your favor, and your beloved ship had to crash
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Obviously it wasnt pretty but you were given another day to live.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
		   So who is this lady standing in front of me?
		   <br>
		   <br>	
		   You were hired by the emerald hegemony to assassinate General Haluk.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   A rogue general that attempted to overhrow the ruling hegemony leadership. No one can get away with that especially in this world....
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Especially against the hegemony.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
		   On a good day you would always trust your ion revolver to get you out of a pinch. Unfortunately you look down at your holster and it's empty.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The revolver probably slipped out during the crash. 
		   <br>
		   <br> 
		   But you are no amatuer, you should have a compact rail pistol strapped on your ankle.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   A little wiggle of your left leg reassures you it is strapped nice and tight.
