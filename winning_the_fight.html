		<h2>YOU HAVE SURVIVED</h2>
		<p>
			A clean shot in the head. the general collapses
			<br>
			<br>
			Your mission is complete. Sloppy, but you got it done. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Your ship is destroyed, but the general kindly left behind a perfectly good ship.
			<br>
			<br>
			Well a ship is a ship, you could probably buy a new one after you confirm your kill and get paid.
			<br>
			<br>
			You board the ship dragging the general's corpse with you. It's a basic dropship nothing to complicated. You take a good look outside the cockpit, and stare at the horizon....
			<br>
			<br>
			"I f***ing hate the desert". The thrusters engage and the ship departs.
			<br>
			<br>
			Just another day in the life of a bounty hunter.
