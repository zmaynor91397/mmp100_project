		<h2>Fighting the general</h2>
		<p>
		   	You don't see any other option but to fight her off. The adrenaline is rushing, and your blood pumps hot through your veins.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	At this point there is about ten feet between where you are standing and the barrel of her rifle.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	Your mind races. It feels like time has slowed down.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	Ok this is it. you have no memory of yourself, so you have no idea how physically capable you are in fight.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	You see a decent size rock at your feet. Big enough to do some damage but not enough to end a fight.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	You grab the rock as fast as you can. you grab it with all your might, and with only one goal in mind. GO FOR THE HEAD. you get back up to throw the rock with every fiber in your being and...
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	BANG
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	"Too slow my friend." she says
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	She saw that coming a mile away. She fired the moment you made eye contact after you grabbed the rock. It was a clean shot, right through the heart.
		   	<br>
		   	<br>
		   	You collapse.
