  		<H1> STRANDED </H1>
		<h2>Waking up</h2>
  		<p>You wake up. Your body is sore and your mind is struggling to adjust.
      <br>
      <br>
      As you gather yourself the metal panels around you start to creak. You realize your on a spaceship and with no recollection of how you got there.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sunlight from outside the ship bleeds into the hull of the vessel. you take a peek outside, and see nothing but miles and miles of sand. You probably crashed on a desert planet.
      <br>
      <br>
      The planet is definitely not volatile since you haven't suffocated or began to vomit your organs out. The oxygen is breathable.
      <br>
      <br>
		  You look around planning out your first move.
