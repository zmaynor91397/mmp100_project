		<h2>Communicating with the unknown object</h2>
		<p>
			You stare at the communication pad waiting for some kind of response.
			<br>
			<br>
			As you're about to cut the connection a lovely voice appears.
			<br>
			<br>
			"what happened exactly??" She says. Her voice is so soft, yet simotaneously feirce. You feel a slightly safer now, but also slightly more confused. Who is this chick?
			<br>
			<br>
			"I honestly dont know. I woke up and i'm on some ship. I'm alone so this is probably my ship. Who is this?" you ask.
			<br>
			<br>
			"oh how adorable. My name is general haluk. You know what, I'm having a slow day, let me come down there and assist you." She kindly says. A bit too kind as a matter of fact.
			<br>
			<br>
			You're a bit hesitant, but the general might just be the answer you need right now. If you deny her assistance, who knows how long until someone else comes along.
			<br>
			<br>
			"Thank you general. hopefully your just the person that could clear all this up for me." you say.
			<br>
			<br>
			"great, stay put my friend. I'll be down in a bit."
			<br>
			<br>
			This could go either way, but you had no other choice.
